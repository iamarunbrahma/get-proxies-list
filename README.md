# Free Proxies List

This script will scrape a list of free proxies available publicly on the internet. This script is built using Python and FastAPI.  
The script is also publicly hosted here: [proxies-api](https://proxies-api.onrender.com/). You can extract contents from this link using the `requests` library.  

Every 5 minutes, a new list of proxies is generated and displayed in the above URL. If you like this project, please ‚≠ê this repo.
